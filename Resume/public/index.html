            properly. I would also respond to residential requests for roof inspections. This task
            included performing the inspection and coming up with the best solution to meet the

        <p class="font-medium">I was tasked with ensuring the safety and security of the residents in the Village of Hills
            and Dales. My position was the full-time afternoon Corporal position. I would conduct
            routine patrols of the Village streets, wooded areas, and vacant homes. Some of my
            daily tasks included monitoring for traffic safety violations, performing routine traffic
            stops, responding to medical calls (I was usually closer than the responding medical
            personnel), and responding to emergency and non-emergency calls for service. Some
            of the routine calls I responded to included residential alarms, vehicle/residential lock
            outs, suspicious vehicles/persons, 911 hang-ups/911
            open lines, and wildlife calls. I performed weekly inspections of the department Police
            Cruisers to ensure all basic and emergency equipment in the vehicles performed as
            needed. Regular house checks were conducted for residents that were on vacation. This included perimeter and interior checks of the
            residence for any signs of damage or criminal activity. On top of these tasks, I maintained a professional and friendly image
            as a representation of the Hills and Dales Police Department. I went above and
            beyond to assist residents with anything I had the power to assist with. I also attended many community based events like National
            Night Out, Shop With a Cop, Coffee With Kids, and Toys for Tots as a representation of
            the department.</p>

            providing near campus escorts for employees to their homes, and working hourly
            rotating posts. I would respond quickly to any
            emergencies or altercations in the hospital and defuse the situation as quickly as
            possible. I would work with my fellow officers to remove trespassing individuals from
            the property, and I would work closely with the Canton Police Department when they
